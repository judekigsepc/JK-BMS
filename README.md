If your  a frontend dev no need for this just skip to [Link to MyFile](MyFile.md)

This is an ongoing project for a **Point of Sale (POS) system** built to facilitate seamless transaction management, inventory tracking, and customer interaction in businesses. The system is under development, and many features are still being refined.

---

### Key Features

- **Real-time Cart Management**: Using **Socket.io** for real-time updates, users can manage their shopping carts efficiently by adding, updating, or removing products.
- **CRUD Operations**: Implementing basic **Create, Read, Update, Delete** operations for managing products, transactions, and users.
- **Discount Handling**: Ability to apply discounts and promo codes for sales transactions.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling mechanism is in place for API calls and real-time updates.
- **Role-based Authentication**: Role-based authentication is functional to ensure that access to certain features is restricted based on the user's role. However, further security enhancements are planned.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Backend**: 
  - **Node.js** with **Express**
  - **MongoDB** for data storage
  - **Socket.io** for real-time communication
- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**
  - **Tailwind CSS** (or your preferred styling framework)

### **Installation & Setup**

To run the POS system locally, follow these steps:

#### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have **Node.js** installed (version 16.x or above recommended).
- **MongoDB**: Ensure MongoDB is installed or use **MongoDB Atlas** for cloud-based databases.

#### Clone the repository and install dependencies

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pos-system.git
   cd pos-system
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables (create a `.env` file in the backend folder with necessary credentials such as the MongoDB URI).

#### Run the application

1. Start the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend:

### **How to Use**

1. **Adding Products**: You can add products to the inventory by making use of the `addProduct` function, which communicates with the server to store product details.
2. **Managing Cart**: Add, update, or delete items from the cart with real-time synchronization using `Socket.io`.
3. **Transactions**: Proceed with checkout, apply discounts, and finalize the payment.

### **Ongoing Development**

The POS system is still under development, and not all features are fully implemented. These are some of the key features that will be available soon:

- Enhanced **security** and **authorization** features
- **Comprehensive reporting** for sales and inventory management
- **Payment gateway integration** for online payments
- **Admin Dashboard** to manage users, products, and sales reports
